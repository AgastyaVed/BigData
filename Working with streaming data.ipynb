The data on this stream represents pressure, temperature and humidity readings from a set of chillers associated with a large office complex. \n\n<img src=\"https://smithbc.blob.core.windows.net/downloads/images/Chiller%20Plant.jpg\" width=500>\n\nLeveraging the data in this stream, calculate an average pressure for each chiller on a 20 second, non-overlapping interval. From the dataset, create a temporary view named **chillers**.  The dataset should include the following fields, **NAMED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED HERE**:\n\n* chiller - the name/id of the chiller as identified within the stream\n* window_start_time - the datetime value representing the start of the window\n* avg_temperatore - the average temperature over the window\n* avg_pressure - the average pressure over the window\n* row_count - the count of records aggregted within the window\n\nDisplay the **chillers** data to the screen for at least 5 minutes before stopping the streaming job.  Save your results to HTML.\n\n**HINT** To calculate the window start time, refer to the documentation on the **window** function where an example is provided.  The link to this documentation is found in the labs.  A line towards the end of the documentation for this function highlights how this value can be retrieved.  Play with it and you'll figure it out :-)"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# connect to the event hub\nconnection_string = \"Endpoint=sb://iothub-ns-iothub-uuv-2655362-368a757296.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey=V+IGBygZk0xp0t+SAya6h72jcGMnFkxw8Is2fs/gVmw=;EntityPath=iothub-uuvws\"\n\n"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# read the data to a dataframe and interpret the payload data"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# answer the question using either programmatic SQL API or a SQL query  "],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Execute the following SQL statements to validate your results:"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql -- verify windows\n\nSELECT min(window_start_time), max(window_start_time) FROM chillers;"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql -- verify values\n\nSELECT distinct chiller from chillers;"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# kill any active streaming jobs\nsqm = spark.streams\nfor q in sqm.active:\n  q.stop()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":10}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 2","language":"python","name":"python2"},"language_info":{"mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython2","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":2},"version":"2.7.15rc1","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"name":"Homework 7","notebookId":3147347766563644},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
